Save to cloud glitch. Cant open my design
 

One of my designs has glitched and is now constantly in 'save to cloud in progress please wait' mode. (see top design on pic). I have left it like this for hours TO SEE IF IT WAS JUST BEING SLOW BUT NO JOY.  However when I open up fusion on my home computer, I can access the design no problem and update and save it. Please help!￼
