Keyshot plugin from General Fusion 360 Questi
Hi, 

 

Sorry if this is a duplicate post - I thought I just asked this question but can't seem to find it so I guess it didn't get posted.

 

I downloaded and installed the Keyshot trial, but I can't find anything Keyshot-related in F360 or vice versa. Their website shows a video with an old version of F360 so the magic menu that they use to make it work isn't there anymore. 

 

Has anyone tried this recently? All the Keyshot posts seem to be from a while ago.. does it still work?

 

Thanks for any info, Rob
