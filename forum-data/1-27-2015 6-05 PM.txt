Generate Low Poly Look
I want to create a model in a distinct low polygon look. See for example:

Any advice on how to get that type of look in Fusion? Since the shape is very simple (a heart), it would be sufficient to find a way to reduce the number of faces of a model. I guess I'd have to use the sculpt workspace for this, correct?

 

Thanks!

Michael
