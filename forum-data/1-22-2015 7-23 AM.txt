Extrude to Sketch Geometry, 2 Side
Working through the youtube video 04_Model Part1 ( http://ift.tt/1uycce1), When I complete the initial extrusion

(in video 1:30 to 2 min range), I get a preview of the side 2 extrusion, but when I click OK in the Extrude dialog box, only the positive Z side remains.â€¨This happens regardless of the order of selection.

Using build 2.0.1403

Please advise if this is a change in workflow or software issue.
