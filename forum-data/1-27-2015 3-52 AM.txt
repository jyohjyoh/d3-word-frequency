June Fusion 360 update fails
Hi All

I am having a problem with the latest update of fusion 360.

Open as normal, update will be installed and will ask for restart. OK

Download gets to around about 20% then fails.

 

Notification to check log file, dont know where this is, and probably not much use to this thicky :-)

 

Can anyone help please
