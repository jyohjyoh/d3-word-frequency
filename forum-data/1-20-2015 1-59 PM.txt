This is the future, to take cnc and product d
Thanks so much for this wonderful user friendly CAD/CAM platform.  I was getting discouraged for my current plans to take high performance ultra low cost CNC capabilities and interactive guide tutorials to the general public.  But not after finding this! 

 

You're licensing model is perfect, understanding that people have to first get into these capabilities, before potentially developing products of various production volumes.  There's massive potential out there in the people of this world, yet for now the barriers the average person faces to develop and commercialize are massive.  I hope to bring you a massive new demographic of paying subscribers, who started with just tinkering or small scale production at home or makerspace, as well as new mass production capability community manufacturing centers.  Also the potential to help cultivate in creativity and problem solving the minds of the next generation is just enormous.  Again, thank you for truly creating hope in the world.
