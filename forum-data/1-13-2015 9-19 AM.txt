as you can see the loft with curvature creates an interesting belly effect which however should not be there.
this makes it impossible to work with loft and G1/G2 the same way I can in Alias or Rhino.

I just checked the report, and I have bad news. Right now, it doesn't appear that this will make it into the January release. I have sent an inquiry to see if we can increase the priority on this issue. I will circle back with an update, good or bad.
 
Thanks,

Thanks for the feedback - this is a serious limitation of the tool right now and and in my case can easily be a show stopper when one would need this modeling approach. The edge rounding (fillet) with G2 does not provide you with the ability to weight each side so one has to use loft with G2/smooth in Fusion.
