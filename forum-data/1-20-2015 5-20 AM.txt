No crash recovery file offeredcreated
Hi,

 

i was just working in CAM with an unsaved design (just copied over some components from another design) when Fusion suddenly crashed. After restart i wasn't offered a crash recovery file and the design of course wasn't saved.

 

I guess this has not happened intentionally, right?
