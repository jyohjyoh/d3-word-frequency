Object to cut feature, how does it work
Hi,

 

So from the January update, I saw that there's now this object to cut feature which should prevent other components to be affected by the cut feature, however till today, I can't seem to get it to work. I attached a screenshot to show how I usually do things, but can't seem to "activate" the cut to only affect the main component and not others.
