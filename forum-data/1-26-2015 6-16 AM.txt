Multiple snapshots
Hey all,

 

I came from SolidEdge, and it has a feature where you can arrange, joint, orient, show/hide your components and then take a snapshot. So lets say you're doing a jewelry box, you can have an exploded view, one with the lid on, one with the lid off, one with a section view. You can then go through and change between them so you can get quick renders and off to marketing or your customer or whatever.

 

Is there any way to do this in Fusion without doing a save as multiple times?

 

I ran into this today because I had drawn my part with some extra stuff for rendering and then decided to start doing CAM work. Well, since it was multiple parts cut out of a single piece of stock I had to reorient the entire assembly as a flat for machining. This meant breaking all my joints, and orientation for rendering. I ended up making two files because I still wanted to go back and render more later if I needed to.

 

Little did I know that I was going to have design changes, and as a result my rendering file is not up to date with my CAM model. So now I have to go back and redo my rendering file so I can get up-to-date renders.

 

Is there a better way to do this?
