Auto Constraints
Working with 2.0.1407

 

When sketching a line to end on another line, no auto constrain appears (I'm looking for Perpendicular), so I end up having to make the line, and adding the constrain after the line is created.

 

Unable to find a place to turn this on, if such a place exists.

 

Thanks
