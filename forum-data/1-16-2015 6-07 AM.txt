January Update and what happened
As we went live with the Jan update we quickly found out that we had an incorrect config file for the MAC.  So we pulled the update to fix it.  We have a fix for it and working out when to release the update.  Will provide an update shortly.

 

Sorry for the convenience.

 

Prabakar.
