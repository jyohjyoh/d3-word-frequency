January Update - Term Has Expired
Last November 2014 I purchased Fusion 360, and was automatically updated to Fusion 360 Ultimate.  I purchased a one year subscription with auto-renewal.  Today I opened Fusion360 and was prompted to install the January Update, so I did.  Once Fusion360 restarted, it now tells me my term has expired, and that I need to "Buy Fusion 360 or Fusion 360 Ultimate" or "Register for Free Use".

 

How do I make this recognize my subscription?
