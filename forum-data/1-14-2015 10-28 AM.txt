A New Way to Visualize Your Designs in Fusion
Want to see your Fusion designs come to life in 2015? Join Autodesk A360’s FREE webinar: A New Way to Visualize Your Designs in Fusion 360!

 

Tuesday, Feb 3, 2015

1-2 PM PST

 

This webinar will highlight a new beta feature called Interactive Rendering. With Interactive Rendering, you can create photorealistic renderings of your designs in real-time! Simply drag and drop lighting environments and materials onto your project, adjust your camera, and then click the render button. With the power of cloud computing, we take the guesswork out of your design process—what you see in the viewport as you work is what your final rendering will look like.
