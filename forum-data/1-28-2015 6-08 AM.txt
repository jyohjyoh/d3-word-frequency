Changing the radius of an arc between to fixe
I'm wanting to change the radius of of an arc between two points, however I want to make those points remain the same distance apart. 

 

I've tried moving the centrepoint of the arc further away which increseaes the radius but I can't specify the radius I actually want.

 

If I change the radius by the dimension tool to the radius I want, the arc increases drastically in size and is completely irrelevant. 

 

 

Hope someone can help!
