2D Drawing questions
How to modify?:

section hatch type

text type and height

text type and height when a section is created

individual text fonts

change the title block

change the title fonts

swap 2d view from front-back-top-bottom-left-right-iso to another one

unlink the 2d view from the parent for free positioning

 

Issue:

Ansi Title block editor: Date overlaps on frame with default text height

 

Note:

I see that in A360 I can analyze my 2d drawing, I can turn on-off layers.

How can I do the same in Fusion?

 

regards
