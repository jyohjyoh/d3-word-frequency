Graphics Card new requirements
I get a message at the top of my screen that says,

 

Your graphics card might not be optimal to run Fusion 360. Please run Graphics Diagnostic under the help menu to get more information.

 

It wants me to set rendering limits.

I would rather upgrade my computer than limit it.

Do you have new requirements for this update?
