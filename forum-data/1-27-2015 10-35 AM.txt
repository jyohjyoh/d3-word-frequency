Toolbar issues again in OS X
Hello:

. . . I am seeing toolbar issues again in OS X (10.10.1 on a iMac, Fusion version 2.0.1407).

  Screencast wasn't showing it well, but I was able to get a QT recording of a reliable method to "break" the toolbars -- which works every time for me here.

  (To "reset", simply go fullscreen and drag the toolbars back to their normal positions.)

Cheers, C
