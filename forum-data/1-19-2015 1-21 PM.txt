Offline ouch
I have a few minutes to work on a model that I created yesterday. My days (newborn and a 3yo) are currently small windows of opportunity, but I can't work on it. I get a little spinner on the project in my dashboard and when I double click on it it says "Save to cloud is in the progress, please wait."

 

First of all, "Save to cloud is in the progress" doesn't make any sense in the English language which I believe was the attempt.

 

Secondly, I really hope all of the offline feedback is taken and AD can shift to a model that puts users back in charge of their F360 files. I'm currently still telling folks how much I like this software, but one of the first things I do is apologize for the cloud lock in.
