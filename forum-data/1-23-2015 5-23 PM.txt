Design History
Is there a way to turn design history off and then back on? or turn on design history half way through a model? There are features like moves that i dont care if they are in my design tree while i can use extrueds and radii in my tree.

 

if this is not an option I would like to add the idea to have an on/off switch on the history

 

thank you
