Game driver
Hello,

 

I had some performance issues and have purchased a video card for Fusion 360. It's a PNY nVidia Geforce GT 730. As I installed the drivers it gave me the option of installing a "gaming" driver. I did so. As I watched, it uninstalled the first driver the CD installed. Should I remove this gaming driver and reload the first one? I'm trying to get better response with a detailed drawing. Moving the part around and such gets slow.

 

Thanks!
