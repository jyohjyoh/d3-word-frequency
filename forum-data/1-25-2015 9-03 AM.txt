Timeline  History bug
Here my steps:

 


Created some components from bodies and apply some features on that.

If i activate a component, the history-timeline shows me only that features that i have applyed to that component.

Now i moved the history marker some features to the left.

I right clicked on right item next to the History Marker and selected "Delete all features after History Marker".

After that, not only the right elements in the activated component are gone but also all features up to the history end are gone too.

 

I think this is a bug?!
