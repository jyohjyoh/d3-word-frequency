need to create shop drawings
I'm about to start a project that will require me to create some shop drawings to build from.  I recall an offer somewhere on this board of a free copy of autocad for ultimate users to get us by till Fusion has a more robust drawing module.  Did I just imagine that, or is that an offer that's still available?  Thanks, I'm going to have to do something. Hoping to not have to purchase another piece of software.
