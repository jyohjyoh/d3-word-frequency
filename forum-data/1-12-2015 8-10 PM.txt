Fusion 360 Ultimate has slowed to a crawl
I've spent most of the day watching the beachball spin.  Loading/saving takes an unusually long time (3-4 min to load). Any file.  A360 Dashboard is also unusually slow (click...wait...wait...wait...). Is it me or are there issues at Autodesk that are causing the slowdown?

 

Thanks for any insight!
