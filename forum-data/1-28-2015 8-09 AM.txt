Dimension the distance to the edge of a circl
Attached is an image to show what I currently have. I'd like to have the circle go into rectangle exactly 2.25mm inches.

In Inventor, I would select the top rectangle line, then select the bottom-most point of the circle and I could set the distance. In Fusion, I'm not able to do that. I'm only able to dimension to the center point.

The workaround, for now, is to dimension between the centerpoint and the rectangle with a function (= diameter/2 - 2.25). Is there a better way?
