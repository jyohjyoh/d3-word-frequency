Hardware Advice to Fix Performance Issues fro
I'm working on a fairly complex assembly (30 components, 100+ sketches, 25 construction planes) and Fusion has become extremely slow. If I do a basic command such creating a sketch or doing an extrude, Fusion spins for a minute before anything happens. It's like trying to write a document and having the word processor spin for a minute everytime you type a letter. 

 

I have a MacBook Pro Mid 2012 with a 2.6 GHz Intel Core i7 processor, 8 GB of memory, and an Intel HD 1024 MB graphics processor.

 

What hardware improvements would you recommend to have Fusion perform at a normal speed for complex assemblies? Is CPU, GPU, or memory more important?

 

Also, what's the best hardware for running Fusion with complex assemblies Would you recommend an iMac or Mac Pro? Would Fusion be able to take advance of a Mac Pro's hardware? If so, which one would you recommend?
