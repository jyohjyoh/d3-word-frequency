unable to reinstall fusion 360
I have been using Fusion 360 on two computers, a iMac, and a win7 laptop. 

Today I was unable to run Fusion on the laptop in cloud mode - it would only run in local mode. 

I made sure I was logged out on the iMac, and restarted the laptop several times.

I saw a couple of comments suggesting reinstalling the application, so I tried that.

I uninstalled, and then downloaded and ran the installer.

The install stops part way through with an error message that instructs me to save the included file.

 

How can I get Fusion 360 reinstalled?
