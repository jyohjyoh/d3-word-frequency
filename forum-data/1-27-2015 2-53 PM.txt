Logging out and in did not fix Term Expired m
I don't seem able to reply to the original post about this. I have logged in and out of my Autodesk account repeatedly and still am blocked by the "term expired" message. This is not coming at a good time for me... 

I should note that I am a paid user, not registered for the free version.
