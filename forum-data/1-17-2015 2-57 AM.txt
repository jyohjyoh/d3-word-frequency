Viewport enhancement Multiple Views
Build 2.0.1403

 

I've just updated to this build and I am taking the new features for a spin.

 

Thank you for the new Multiple Views feature! Not logged enough time yet to check for any issues (at this time).

 

It is particularly useful for the type of work I want to do with Fusion. I have been evaluating application on design of large structures such as bridges.

Very large radius curves (i.e. camber) are a requirement of bridge structures. With one viewport, navigating & sketching was frustrating / laborious  / suseptible to human errors.

 

With multiple views (interacting); Easier tracking and continuity of critical points of the sketch should be now possible - so many thanks again!
