Undo behaviour in sketches still broken
I think it would just again not get awareness if i  just comment on the idea so i'll post it here this time.

 The undo behaviour in sketches is broken like forever now.

 

Here's my idea station post from July 2014:  http://ift.tt/1CecKqf - the idea is "under review" since then.

 

The behaviour still exists in the actual version. In this case:

 

- using the project tool

- pressing cmd+z (undo) once disables the tool

- pressing cmd+z the second time does the actual undo

- the tool is gone.

 

expected behaviour:

 

- using the project tool

- pressing cmd+z does the actual undo

- continue using the project tool

 

The additional comment on this topic i added later is also still valid.

 

Thanks for consideration!

 Frank
