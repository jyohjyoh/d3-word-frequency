tsplines can I crease at a vertex
I can't seem to crease at a vertex. I have a flat plane that I'm trying to get to shape before I extrude it.

 

You can see a few places that are already creased, and two areas I would like to crease.

But when I use the crease tool, it creases both ends of an edge

Any ideas?

 

 

Is this the only solution, to add an edge and then crease?
