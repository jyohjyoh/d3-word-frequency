Browser shows no content
Hello, Earlier today Fusion 360 was unresponsive and I force quit. After restarting I noticed that the browser was unpopulated. Assuming I had inadvertently made some change I reset the user preferences to default but the CAM browser remained unpopulated. I restarted the computer and the issue persisted. I've now reinstalled the program and the issue remains. My only guess is that somehow a setting in my Autodesk 360 cloud profile has caused this. I'm not sure how to proceed. Has anyone experienced this before? How might I resolve this issue? I am running on Windows 7 Professional, SP1. ￼
